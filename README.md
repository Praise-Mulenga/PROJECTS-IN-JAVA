# CSC 2000 Projects README

Welcome to my CSC 2000 projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects I worked on during my second year at the University of Zambia while studying Computer Science (CSC) 2000. These projects range from simple terminal-based applications to more complex JavaFX GUI applications. Each project is designed to showcase various programming concepts and problem-solving skills I learned during the course.

## Calculator (JavaFX)

### Description
- A basic calculator application built using JavaFX for the graphical user interface.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic calculations.

### How to Run
- Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
- Clone the repository and navigate to the Calculator directory.
- Compile and run the `Calculator.java` file.

## Terminal-based Projects

### Maximum Area of Water in a Container
- Calculates the maximum area of water that can be contained within a given set of container heights.

### Sorting and Removing Duplicates from an Array
- Implements sorting algorithms and removes duplicate elements from an array.

### Largest Number and Its Index in an Array
- Finds the largest number in an array and its corresponding index.

### Largest Number in an Array
- Determines the largest number in an array without considering its index.

### Multiplication of Dynamic Matrices
- Multiplies dynamically sized matrices together.

### Sorting an Array Using Bubble Sort Algorithm
- Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm.

### Sum of Numbers in an Array
- Calculates the sum of all numbers in an array.

### Calculating Tax Using Tax Bands
- Computes tax amounts based on predefined tax bands.

### Addition Matrix
- Performs addition operation on matrices.

### Alphabet Grid
- Generates and displays a grid of alphabets.

### Demonstration of JDBC by Getting Data from MySQL Database
- Fetches data from a MySQL database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).
- Demonstrates database interaction and retrieval of information for problem-solving.

## Running Terminal-based Projects
- Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
- Clone the repository and navigate to the respective project directory.
- Compile the Java files and run the main class file to execute the program.

Feel free to explore each project and delve into the code to understand the implementation details. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out!
